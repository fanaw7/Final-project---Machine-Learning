Final Project - Absenteeism At Work

The objective of this project is to use a machine learning algorithm of our choice to optimize a test-train split for our desired dataset. For the dataset we chose, we wanted the algorithm to analyze a list of employeeâ€™s information and predict whether or not any features are directly correlated to the amount of hours the  employee misses from work.

Team Members: Fana Wachamo, Debora Rogers, Amon Thomas, and Charne Jewell-Hart.
